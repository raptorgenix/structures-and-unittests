# structures-and-unittests
These files are a collection of template classes for structures (tree, hashmap, and linear structures) that include functions to generate these objects and modify them through insertion/deletion operations (and more, depending on the structure type.) The test.cpp file includes test cases to verify that the functions and structures/constructors are all in working order.
